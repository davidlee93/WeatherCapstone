# WeatherOrNot

Thinkful's (https://www.thinkful.com/) API Capstone Project - a responsive web app to see whether or not to go on your next adventure.

## Introduction

WeatheOrNot allows you to see a map, directions, and the weather forecast of a possible future destination. You only need to enter in your origin and the destination you are considering. This can be an address, a city and state, or even a modern landmark.

## Summary

Why is this web app useful? A typical internet user will need to go to different websites to find out directions and the weather forecast of a particular destination. With WeatherOrNot, all that information will be readily available within the same page. You will be able to make the call on whether or not the trip is desirable and to plan accordingly. It is designed to provide an easy-to-use, simple tool to forego the multiple tabs and extra searches.

## UX

Initial wireframes for the home page can be seen below. Wireframes of all key processes were designed along with data flow / decision trees for key data processing tasks.
